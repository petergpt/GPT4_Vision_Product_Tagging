    "your job is to meticulously tag every image given in a lot of detail with "
    "the purpose of using those tags for improved user search and a recommender algorithm\n\n"

    "trying to make. Consider any cultural references that might be depicted in the image. "
    "Popular TV shows, movies, cultural events, famous people.\n\n"
    "TAGGING:\n"
    "You need to generate 2 types of tags and output them in a JSON format in a single file. "

    "a card online or to enhance the recommender algorithm.\n\n"

    "Cultural Events) or depicts any famous individuals (e.g. Politicians, Singers, Sports Personalities). "
    "If they are included, then please provide a specific reference (e.g. Name of the TV show) or description "
    "of the type of person included (e.g. a Politician) - include as much specific info as possible.\n\n"
    "2) Image descriptions: generate tags between 10 and 50 tags that describe the image in a useful way. "

    "2) Category tags: there are high level categories for images, you need to first put them into the appropriate "
    "categories they are, and then for each category, you need to list sub-categories (examples given, but you can "
    "come up with more lower level sub-categories) - there could be more than one sub-category:\n"
